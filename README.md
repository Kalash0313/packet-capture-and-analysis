Date of Capture: 11/08/2025
Interface Used: Wi-Fi
Capture Duration: 1 minute
File Format: .pcapng

Protocols Found
	1.	HTTP – Handles communication between web browsers and servers, transferring website data.
	2.	DNS – Resolves human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
	3.	TCP – Ensures reliable, connection-oriented data transfer between devices.
	4.	UDP – Provides fast, connectionless communication for services like DNS lookups.

Observations
	•	HTTP Traffic: Multiple GET and POST requests observed while browsing websites.
	•	DNS Queries: Domain names (e.g., google.com) resolved to IP addresses.
	•	TCP Sessions: Established for reliable data delivery (HTTP & HTTPS traffic).
	•	UDP Packets: Used mainly for quick DNS responses.


This packet capture demonstrates a typical web browsing session. DNS queries were used to resolve domain names, HTTP transferred website content, TCP ensured reliable communication, and UDP supported lightweight communication. This illustrates how multiple protocols work together to enable smooth internet usage.
